# Live-texturing-of-book-images-using-AR

The proposed system provides 3D view of an object using Augmented Reality(AR) by detecting the
image/object using object detection. The system provides 3D view of any organ so student can see
all the components very clearly and understand it in very easy way because visuals are much more
powerful then reading so this will enhance the readers experience.
